HANGMAN!!!

I'm VERY proud of this game- This is the game that made me love Node.Js.

Tech used: Back-End JavaScript, body-parser, express,  express-session, express-validator, file-share,  mustache-express, and CSS.

To run after downloading, run node app.js in terminal, then open http://localhost:3000/

Have fun!
